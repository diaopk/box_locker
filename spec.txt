* Replace physical keypad with vitrual keypad
  In the group project, we use LCD Screen to display the keypad instead of
  physical keypad. To do this, we use one of the python module called 
  TKinter to create a User interface on the screen.

* Expected demo
    A box with LCD screen and a camera on the top of the box can capture 
    whoever try to enter a pin and open the box. If someone try to open the
    the box with a wrong pin, s/he will be captured as the piture that will
    be displaied on the LCD and sent to the admin through Email. People 
    only can enter pin on the LCD.
